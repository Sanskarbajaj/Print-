Hi [Manager’s Name],

I’ve tried multiple approaches to get Ant Design working in our current setup (Preact + Micro Frontend), but it’s not compatible due to technical limitations. Here’s what I did:
	1.	Forced the latest react-is version via package.json — didn’t solve the ForwardRef error.
	2.	Removed plugins and downgraded React dependencies — still failed.
	3.	Tried loading AntD via CDN — files loaded, but components didn’t render.
	4.	Verified we’re using React 19 — the issue exists even in React 17+.

Root Cause:
Ant Design is CommonJS-based and doesn’t play well with our ESM-only, Preact + Web Components setup.

Recommendation:
We should switch to an ESM-friendly UI library like Shoelace or Mantine, or use a separate React-based MFE just for AntD.

Let me know how you’d like to proceed.

Best,
[Your Name]
